This is something I fiddled with back in the Spring and Summer of 2013.  Just a simple tile-based thing.  I wouldn't call it a game, as there is nothing resembling gameplay, other than the fact that the characters can slide around the map.

This is no longer maintained.  After some realizations that things could be better-organized as my object-oriented programming class wrapped up, I got fed up with trying to adjust it to be properly object-oriented.  This is really here just as an example of where I once was.  Also, this is a fantastic example of programmer art.

Controls:
Space: Pause/Unpause the game into/out of tactical mode
Left click: Select a character (all characters are selectable)
Right click: Select a tile for the selected character to travel to
Character actions occur upon coming out of tactical mode
